Welcome to the SampleApp
========================
This is a rails sample application based on Michael Hartl's Ruby on Rails Tutorial, which is available 
here: <http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book>

This Document is written in markdown, see
<http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax>

It was first written for rails 3.0.1, then successively migrated first to rails 3.1 and then 3.2. It might therefore differ from the version described in the book that is now directly written for rails 3.2
